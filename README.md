# Password Generator Project

This project is a password generator that was assigned as our weekly project. The task was to create a program that generates secure and random passwords based on user-specified criteria. The program should allow the user to select the password length and choose whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Motivation

Our motivation behind building this password generator project was to create a tool to help users quickly generate strong and unique passwords. In today's digital age, where we have numerous online accounts and the need for strong passwords is paramount, it becomes challenging to come up with complex passwords that are not easily guessable. We wanted to provide a simple and convenient solution to this problem by automating the generation of strong passwords.

## Problem Solving

The password generator solves the problem of creating secure passwords by offering a customizable approach. Users can specify the length and character types they want to include in their password. By generating random passwords using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, the program ensures that the generated passwords are strong and challenging to crack. This tool eliminates the need for users to manually brainstorm and create complex passwords, thus saving time and increasing security.

## Learning and Development

While working on this project, we learned several valuable skills and concepts. Firstly, we gained a deeper understanding of random number generation and its importance in generating secure passwords. We also learned about string manipulation and how to combine different characters to form a password. Additionally, we improved our programming skills by implementing user input validation and error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

We built this project to enhance our programming knowledge and contribute to the growing need for secure password generation. By developing this password generator, we aimed to create a practical tool that individuals and organizations can use to enhance their online security and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
